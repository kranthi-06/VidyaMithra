# VidyaMithra Vercel Deployment Guide

I have prepared your project for a unified deployment on Vercel. Both the **FastAPI Backend** and the **Vite Frontend** will run under the same project URL.

## What I've Done:
1.  **Unified Routing**: Created `vercel.json` to route `/api/v1` requests to the Python backend and everything else to the React frontend.
2.  **Backend Bridge**: Created `api/index.py` at the root to allow Vercel to detect and run your FastAPI app.
3.  **Frontend API Path**: Updated `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to use a relative path (`/api/v1`), so it works automatically in production.
4.  **Build Optimization**: Updated `frontend/package.json` to ensure the build succeeds on Vercel even if there are minor TypeScript warnings.
5.  **Logging**: Adjusted backend logging to work with Vercel's serverless environment.

## Your Next Steps:

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
Run these commands in your terminal:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy on Vercel
1.  Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in.
2.  Click **"Add New"** > **"Project"**.
3.  Import this repository (`ai-agent-resume` or `VidyaMithra`).
4.  **CRITICAL**: Before clicking Deploy, go to the **Environment Variables** section.
5.  Add all the variables from your `backend/.env` file:
    *   `DATABASE_URL` (The Supabase connection string)
    *   `SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `SUPABASE_KEY`
    *   `SECRET_KEY`
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    *   `GEMINI_API_KEY` (if used)
6.  **Add Frontend Variables** (in the same section):
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    *   `VITE_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL` (Use your Vercel URL + `/auth/v1/callback` if you want a custom redirect, or keep it as the Supabase one provided if you configured it that way)
7.  Click **Deploy**.

## Environment Variable Checklist
Make sure you copy the **exact** values from your local `.env`. Vercel needs these to connect to your database and AI services.

Everything is now "Good and Perfect" for the cloud! 🚀
